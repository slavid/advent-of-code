# Advent of Code 2022

Some spaguetti code written in Java of the first 6 days of the [2022 Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/).

As days went by I remembered more of what I learnt about Java in the University that, apparently, I was forgetting and so I feel like my coding looks more clean each day that went by.
